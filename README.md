## How to use

1. The webapp is running through github-pages, and can be used through the link above.
2. The servers are deployed using Render's services, and the app can therefore be used freely without any installations or configurations. It may however be slow on the first data-request,
   as it uses Render's free services. After the first request however, the app should run smoothly.
4. If you want to download the sourcecode and run it locally instead, clone the repo with: git clone https://github.com/magnusgit1/quiz-game.git, and run using npm start / npm run dev.
